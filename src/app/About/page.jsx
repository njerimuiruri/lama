                                                Despite growing interest in accelerating locally led adaptation (LLA), evidence on effective interventions, vulnerability-specific approaches, and investment opportunities remains scarce. This gap is primarily due to the absence of dedicated bottom-up indicators or community-led frameworks and metrics.

                                                Africa currently hosts numerous adaptation interventions and projects, each operating in isolation, hindered by geographical, linguistic, ethnic, sectoral, and disciplinary disparities. The LAMA Platform addresses this challenge by fostering learning and consolidation of locally led adaptation indicators across Africa.
