It is calculated as the ratio between total freshwater withdrawn by all major sectors and total renewable freshwater resources, after taking into account environmental flow requirements. Main sectors, as defined by ISIC standards, include agriculture; forestry and fishing; manufacturing; electricity industry; and services. Data on water withdrawals and total water resources available are commonly collected by national line ministries and institutions (e.g. for Water, Agriculture and Environment) and the National Statistical Office and can be used to assess current status and trends over time. ",
    "Rationale of the indicator\n(with adaptation and global relevance) ": "This indicator is a measure of the sustainability of water withdrawals and supply of freshwater to address water scarcity. Lower water stress directly reduces vulnerability and enhances community resilience, ensuring reliable water supplies for households, agriculture, and industry. Adaptation actions such as improved water management and conservation buffer the impacts of drought and variability, safeguarding livelihoods and ecosystems against climate-induced stress.\n\nThis indicator builds on the existing global indicator SDG 6.4.2, which is an established outcome indicator with existing guidance and system of reporting under SDG 6.4.2. Part of a Global set of Climate Change Statistics and Indicators adopted by UN Statistical Commission in 2022. Included in UNSD/UNEP/OECD/ Eurostat Questionnaire on Environment Statistics.\n\n",

It considers water use by all economic activities, with a focus on agriculture, industry and the service sector. Data on water use are commonly available from the records of national line ministries and institutions (e.g. for Water, Agriculture and Environment), and data on value generation in different sectors are commonly available from the National Statistical Office and can be used to assess current status and trends over time.",
    "Rationale of the indicator\n(with adaptation and global relevance) ": "Increasing water-use efficiency reduces vulnerability to climate change by maximizing the benefits from existing water resources.\n\nThe modified indicator builds on the existing global indicator \"SDG 6.4.1: Change in water-use efficiency over time\", which is an established output indicator with existing guidance and system of reporting under SDG 6.4.1. Measured as the ratio of dollar value added to the volume of water used. Can be disaggregated by sector (agriculture, forestry and fishing, industry and services). Can be used to target sectors with high use and low efficiency. Data on water use comes from national line ministries and data on value generation from National Statistical Offices. Increasing water-use efficiency (repairing leaking water distribution systems, using less thirsty crops and investing in new technology) can result in more sustainable and resilient food and industrial production systems. Water savings are also associated with energy savings, as less water needs to be extracted, treated, transported and heated. ",

Critical water infrastructure refers to essential water-related systems and facilities that have the ability to prevent, protect against, or recover from disasters. This ensures that services essential for the maintenance of vital societal functions, economic activities, public health and safety, or the environment (essential services) are constantly available. Critical water related infrastructure could include among others (and it is not limited to) drinking water suppliers and distributor networks, reservoirs, dams, wastewater collection and treatment plants, electricity production like hydropower, transport on water and flood protection systems, irrigation systems and supporting assets like pumps and control centers. Water and sanitation infrastructure may be considered critical for health, education, agriculture, industry or other purposes. Data on the number and proportion of critical water and sanitation infrastructure systems that are designed, built or retrofitted to withstand climate-related hazards is typically available from National Adaptation Plans, or equivalent policy instruments, and from relevant national line ministries and institutions (e.g. for Water, Agriculture and Environment).",
    "Rationale of the indicator\n(with adaptation and global relevance) ": "Critical infrastructure systems are essential for the functioning of societies and economies. Upgrading water infrastructure (water and sewage treatment plants, irrigation, hydropower and multipurpose dams, pipelines, drinking water infrastructure e.g reservoirs, pipelines, groundwater wells and mountain springs) strengthens the ability to withstand floods, droughts, and other climate related extreme events, reducing disruption and ensuring safe water access for drinking, sanitiation, agriculture, industry, energy and health under changing climate conditions.  These water and sanitation infrastructure systems ensure the continuous supply and quality of water, enable safe disposal of wastewater, support flood control, and are essential for ensuring public health and safety and sustaining economic activities. This is crucial for economic growth and productivity and protecting public health.",

The goal is to eventually reach 100% of the total area of a basin (lake, river or aquifer) for which a climate risk assessment is conducted/updated and an adaptation plan developed and implemented under an integrated water resources management approach. Data on the number and proportion of basins (including transboundary basins) that have developed and implemented climate adaptation plans as part of an integrated water resources management approach are typically available from national line ministries and institutions (e.g. for Water, Agriculture and Environment).",
    "Rationale of the indicator\n(with adaptation and global relevance) ": "Regular climate risk assessment and adaptation planning for river basins, aquifers, and lakes, as well as the cryosphere (such as snow, glaciers, ice sheets, and permafrost), identify vulnerabilities and guide strategic interventions. Integrated water resources management ensures sustainable use, balancing water needs for people, environment, and economy under climate uncertainties. The modified indicator builds on and combines established process indicators with existing guidance and system of reporting under SDG 6.5.1 (water resources management) and 6.5.2 (transboundary cooperation). We recommend that disaggregated information is collected for individual river basins and lake basins and then aggregated for global reporting.\n\nSpecifically for the cryosphere, almost 70% of Earth’s freshwater is stored as snow or ice. Runoff from glaciers, snow and ice are essential for drinking water, agriculture, industry and clean energy production. Climate and cryosphere change impact the water cycle, including changing the amount and timing of glacier melt and snowmelt discharge, groundwater recharge and low flows, and contribute to sea level rise. Integrated water management approaches across multiple scales can be effective at addressing impacts and leveraging opportunities from cryosphere changes in high mountain areas (IPCC SROCC SPM C2.6).",

In addition to reporting on computed overall prevalence, disaggregated information can be provided to by social groups and geographies that are most impacted by climate change.",
    "Rationale of the indicator\n(with adaptation and global relevance) ": "Climate change is already negatively affecting food and nutrition security through both direct impacts of slow onset aspects (change in temperature, precipitation patterns, dry spells, droughts, changes in seasonality, salinization of soils in coastal areas, coastal habitat loss etc.) and rapid onset extreme events (i.e., heavy precipitations, heatwaves, floods, pest outbreaks etc.). There are multiple transmission channels through which these impacts materialise including impacts on crop yields, on agricultural labour and therefore crop production and agricultural income, on non-agricultural labour and non-agricultural income, on health and the ability to earn enough to afford food, on food prices and therefore the affordability of food, and on food supply chains and therefore the variety of food. Tracking changes in the prevalence of food insecurity associated with climate change can enable the design and targeting of safety nets (food and/or cash) and other interventions to strengthen resilience.",

The survey asks Member States a series of questions regarding the status of implementation of EWSs for each of the health risks that are relevant to each Party, which serve to indicate the extent of operationalisation. These questions include (1) whether a Climate-Informed health EWS allowing the prediction of specific health risks is available; whether climate-informed health EWS includes a mechanism to communicate early warnings to general public in a timely manner based on pre-defined warning thresholds; and whether there is a health sector response plan in place. For the construction of this indicator, each of this questions will receive a score following the methodology used by the WHO in the analysis of Survey results. Scores will be averaged for the different diseases. The global indicator will report the average score for all Parties. ",
    "Rationale of the indicator\n(with adaptation and global relevance) ": "Climate influences the transmission of many infectious diseases, some of which being among the most important causes of death and morbidity in developing countries. Commonly, these diseases occur as epidemics which may be triggered by variations in climatic conditions that imply higher transmission rates. Strengthening EWS for climate sensitive health hazards becomes fundamental under conditions of rapid global environmental change. EWS are tools for detecting and predicting an impending disease outbreak, and delivering accessible warnings to relevant populations, thereby triggering early health-protective responses. EWS is an information system designed to support decision- making of national and local-level institutions to enable vulnerable groups in society to take action to mitigate the impacts of an impending risk. EWS help improve coordination among relevant stakeholders, such as local epidemiologists, meteorologists, entomologists, the national and local management agencies that assess risk and develop response strategies, and the public communication channels used to disseminate warning information. Effective risk monitoring and EWS can prevent illness, injury and death when coupled with adequate communication and response capacity. The use of EWS can increase the effectiveness of disease control by intervening before or at the beginning of the epidemic curve. The core elements of climate-informed EWS are to: (i) monitor environmental conditions; (ii) forecast high-risk conditions, initiate active surveillance; (iii) send alerts and communication; and (iv) establish a mechanism for early response.",
